                    Filmmaker enthusiast originally from Monaco now working as a data scientist in London. I discovered
                    the magic of filmmaking at the age of 10, and it has since then been a
                    hobby that I enjoyed sharing with my friends through social networks, mainly through my YouTube
                    channel.

                    Starting with my father's camera, I learned to use new gear throughout the years, now mainly
                    using a Canon Legria HV40 and a Nikon D7000, as well as software such as Final Cut Pro X, Motion
                    5, Adobe After Effects and Adobe Photoshop CC.
