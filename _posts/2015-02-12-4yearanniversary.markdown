It's already been 4 years since the creation of Adamouization with my first upload to my YouTube channel! 

I can't thank you enough for all the support I've received since I started out in 2011! 

By 2013 we had already reached 1.3 million views and 2000 subscribers, but although my previous channel was deleted due 
to copyright reasons, the achievement and the support was what mattered! I learned a lot in terms of filmmaking 
techniques and that would not have happened if I didn't have anyone to show it to!

So I want to take the time to thank every single person who clicked on the like or subscribe button on YouTube, 
Facebook, Instagram, Soundcloud or Vine: what you see in this video wouldn't have been possible without you!
