Short edit of my trip to Mauritius during the summer of 2016. It was a great place to relax but also to do a lot of water
sports and to capture great shots!

The main challenge of this video was to film everything with no professional equipment (I left my Canon Legria HV40 and 
Nikon D7000 at home), using only my iPhone 6 and my GoPro Hero 3 Black.
